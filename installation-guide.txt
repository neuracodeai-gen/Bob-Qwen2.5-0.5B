📌 To Install, Make Sure You Have:
    🛠️ The Required Dependencies:
        🐍 Flask
        🤖 Ollama
        🚀 gunicorn

    ⚠️ If Not:
        🌐 You should have a stable internet connection so that the installer can install them.
🥇 Step #1:
    💻 Run: run-bob.exe

⚠️ If the file shows errors:

    🔄 Run run_bob.bat
    ✅ That should do it, as long as you have stable internet.

🥈 Step #2:
    🌐 Open: 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser

🎉 Now that you have the application and its dependencies installed, you can run the program directly from:
▶️ run.bat
